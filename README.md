Abstract: A utility token pegged to Naira provides individuals and organizations for settlement and day to day transactions. The token runs on Binance smart chain using proof of staked authority PoSA), where participants stake BNB to become validators. If they propose a valid block, theyâ€™ll receive transaction fees from the transactions included in it. We ensured a one-to-one reserve ratio between Naira fiat currency and Tarocoin token through proof of Reserves to maintain accountability all times.
